          I'm Siddhi Rungta, a passionate 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student at Jain Deemed-to-be University. 
          My journey in the world of technology began in 2020 when I was in grade 11 by choosing computer science as my subject, and since then, I've been exploring the vast and exciting 
          realm of computer science. I am currently in my 4th semester pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
          Growing up, my fascination with computers led me to discover my love for creating and designing. I have always been drawn to 
          the endless possibilities that computer science offers in terms of creativity. Currently, I am diving into the dynamic world of web development. 
          I am honing my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing websites.
